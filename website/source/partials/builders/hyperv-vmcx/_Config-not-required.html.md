-   `memory` (uint) - The amount, in megabytes, of RAM to assign to the
VM. By default, this is 1 GB.

-   `secondary_iso_images` ([]string) - A list of ISO paths to
attach to a VM when it is booted. This is most useful for unattended
Windows installs, which look for an Autounattend.xml file on removable
media. By default, no secondary ISO will be attached.

-   `guest_additions_mode` (string) - If set to attach then attach and
mount the ISO image specified in guest_additions_path. If set to
none then guest additions are not attached and mounted; This is the
default.

-   `guest_additions_path` (string) - The path to the ISO image for guest
additions.

-   `clone_from_vmcx_path` (string) - This is the path to a directory containing an exported virtual machine.

-   `clone_from_vm_name` (string) - This is the name of the virtual machine to clone from.

-   `clone_from_snapshot_name` (string) - The name of a snapshot in the
source machine to use as a starting point for the clone. If the value
given is an empty string, the last snapshot present in the source will
be chosen as the starting point for the new VM.

-   `clone_all_snapshots` (bool) - If set to true all snapshots
present in the source machine will be copied when the machine is
cloned. The final result of the build will be an exported virtual
machine that contains all the snapshots of the parent.

-   `vm_name` (string) - This is the name of the new virtual machine,
without the file extension. By default this is "packer-BUILDNAME",
where "BUILDNAME" is the name of the build.

-   `differencing_disk` (bool) - If true enables differencing disks. Only
the changes will be written to the new disk. This is especially useful if
your source is a VHD/VHDX. This defaults to false.

-   `switch_name` (string) - The name of the switch to connect the virtual
machine to. By default, leaving this value unset will cause Packer to
try and determine the switch to use by looking for an external switch
that is up and running.

-   `copy_in_compare` (bool) - When cloning a vm to build from, we run a powershell
Compare-VM command, which, depending on your version of Windows, may need
the "Copy" flag to be set to true or false. Defaults to "false". Command:

-   `switch_vlan_id` (string) - This is the VLAN of the virtual switch's
network card. By default none is set. If none is set then a VLAN is not
set on the switch's network card. If this value is set it should match
the VLAN specified in by vlan_id.

-   `mac_address` (string) - This allows a specific MAC address to be used on
the default virtual network card. The MAC address must be a string with
no delimiters, for example "0000deadbeef".

-   `vlan_id` (string) - This is the VLAN of the virtual machine's network
card for the new virtual machine. By default none is set. If none is set
then VLANs are not set on the virtual machine's network card.

-   `cpus` (uint) - The number of CPUs the virtual machine should use. If
this isn't specified, the default is 1 CPU.

-   `generation` (uint) - The Hyper-V generation for the virtual machine. By
default, this is 1. Generation 2 Hyper-V virtual machines do not support
floppy drives. In this scenario use secondary_iso_images instead. Hard
drives and DVD drives will also be SCSI and not IDE.

-   `enable_mac_spoofing` (bool) - If true enable MAC address spoofing
for the virtual machine. This defaults to false.

-   `enable_dynamic_memory` (bool) - If true enable dynamic memory for
the virtual machine. This defaults to false.

-   `enable_secure_boot` (bool) - If true enable secure boot for the
virtual machine. This defaults to false. See secure_boot_template
below for additional settings.

-   `secure_boot_template` (string) - The secure boot template to be
configured. Valid values are "MicrosoftWindows" (Windows) or
"MicrosoftUEFICertificateAuthority" (Linux). This only takes effect if
enable_secure_boot is set to "true". This defaults to "MicrosoftWindows".

-   `enable_virtualization_extensions` (bool) - If true enable
virtualization extensions for the virtual machine. This defaults to
false. For nested virtualization you need to enable MAC spoofing,
disable dynamic memory and have at least 4GB of RAM assigned to the
virtual machine.

-   `temp_path` (string) - The location under which Packer will create a
directory to house all the VM files and folders during the build.
By default %TEMP% is used which, for most systems, will evaluate to
%USERPROFILE%/AppData/Local/Temp.

-   `configuration_version` (string) - This allows you to set the vm version when
 calling New-VM to generate the vm.

-   `keep_registered` (bool) - If "true", Packer will not delete the VM from
The Hyper-V manager.

-   `communicator` (string) - Communicator
-   `skip_compaction` (bool) - If true skip compacting the hard disk for
the virtual machine when exporting. This defaults to false.

-   `skip_export` (bool) - If true Packer will skip the export of the VM.
If you are interested only in the VHD/VHDX files, you can enable this
option. The resulting VHD/VHDX file will be output to
<output_directory>/Virtual Hard Disks. By default this option is false
and Packer will export the VM to output_directory.

-   `headless` (bool) - Packer defaults to building Hyper-V virtual
machines by launching a GUI that shows the console of the machine being
built. When this value is set to true, the machine will start without a
console.
