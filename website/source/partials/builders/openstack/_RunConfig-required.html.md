-   `source_image` (string) - The ID or full URL to the base image to use. This
is the image that will be used to launch a new server and provision it.
Unless you specify completely custom SSH settings, the source image must
have cloud-init installed so that the keypair gets assigned properly.

-   `source_image_name` (string) - The name of the base image to use. This is
an alternative way of providing source_image and only either of them can
be specified.

-   `source_image_filter` (ImageFilter) - The search filters for determining the base
image to use. This is an alternative way of providing source_image and
only one of these methods can be used. source_image will override the
filters.

-   `flavor` (string) - The ID, name, or full URL for the desired flavor for
the server to be created.
