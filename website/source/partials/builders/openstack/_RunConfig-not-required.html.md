<!-- Code generated from the comments of the RunConfig struct in builder/openstack/run_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

-   `availability_zone` (string) - The availability zone to launch the server
in. If this isn't specified, the default enforced by your OpenStack cluster
will be used. This may be required for some OpenStack clusters.

-   `rackconnect_wait` (bool) - For rackspace, whether or not to wait for
Rackconnect to assign the machine an IP address before connecting via SSH.
Defaults to false.

-   `floating_ip_network` (string) - The ID or name of an external network that
can be used for creation of a new floating IP.

-   `floating_ip` (string) - A specific floating IP to assign to this instance.

-   `reuse_ips` (bool) - Whether or not to attempt to reuse existing
unassigned floating ips in the project before allocating a new one. Note
that it is not possible to safely do this concurrently, so if you are
running multiple openstack builds concurrently, or if other processes are
assigning and using floating IPs in the same openstack project while packer
is running, you should not set this to true. Defaults to false.

-   `security_groups` ([]string) - A list of security groups by name to
add to this instance.

-   `networks` ([]string) - A list of networks by UUID to attach to
this instance.

-   `ports` ([]string) - A list of ports by UUID to attach to this
instance.

-   `user_data` (string) - User data to apply when launching the instance. Note
that you need to be careful about escaping characters due to the templates
being JSON. It is often more convenient to use user_data_file, instead.
Packer will not automatically wait for a user script to finish before
shutting down the instance this must be handled in a provisioner.

-   `user_data_file` (string) - Path to a file that will be used for the user
data when launching the instance.

-   `instance_name` (string) - Name that is applied to the server instance
created by Packer. If this isn't specified, the default is same as
image_name.

-   `instance_metadata` (map[string]string) - Metadata that is
applied to the server instance created by Packer. Also called server
properties in some documentation. The strings have a max size of 255 bytes
each.

-   `force_delete` (bool) - Whether to force the OpenStack instance to be
forcefully deleted. This is useful for environments that have
reclaim / soft deletion enabled. By default this is false.

-   `config_drive` (bool) - Whether or not nova should use ConfigDrive for
cloud-init metadata.

-   `floating_ip_pool` (string) - Deprecated use floating_ip_network
instead.

-   `use_blockstorage_volume` (bool) - Use Block Storage service volume for
the instance root volume instead of Compute service local volume (default).

-   `volume_name` (string) - Name of the Block Storage service volume. If this
isn't specified, random string will be used.

-   `volume_type` (string) - Type of the Block Storage service volume. If this
isn't specified, the default enforced by your OpenStack cluster will be
used.

-   `volume_size` (int) - Size of the Block Storage service volume in GB. If
this isn't specified, it is set to source image min disk value (if set) or
calculated from the source image bytes size. Note that in some cases this
needs to be specified, if use_blockstorage_volume is true.

-   `volume_availability_zone` (string) - Availability zone of the Block
Storage service volume. If omitted, Compute instance availability zone will
be used. If both of Compute instance and Block Storage volume availability
zones aren't specified, the default enforced by your OpenStack cluster will
be used.

-   `openstack_provider` (string) - Not really used, but here for BC

-   `use_floating_ip` (bool) - Deprecated use floating_ip or
floating_ip_pool instead.
