-   `cpus` (int) - The number of cpus to use when building the VM.

-   `memory` (int) - The amount of memory to use when building the VM
in megabytes.

-   `cores` (int) - The number of cores per socket to use when building the VM.
This corresponds to the cpuid.coresPerSocket option in the .vmx file.

-   `network` (string) - This is the network type that the virtual machine will
be created with. This can be one of the generic values that map to a device
such as hostonly, nat, or bridged. If the network is not one of these
values, then it is assumed to be a VMware network device. (VMnet0..x)

-   `network_adapter_type` (string) - This is the ethernet adapter type the the
virtual machine will be created with. By default the e1000 network adapter
type will be used by Packer. For more information, please consult the

Choosing a network adapter for your virtual machine for desktop VMware
clients. For ESXi, refer to the proper ESXi documentation.

-   `sound` (bool) - Specify whether to enable VMware's virtual soundcard
device when building the VM. Defaults to false.

-   `usb` (bool) - Enable VMware's USB bus when building the guest VM.
Defaults to false. To enable usage of the XHCI bus for USB 3 (5 Gbit/s),
one can use the vmx_data option to enable it by specifying true for
the usb_xhci.present property.

-   `serial` (string) - This specifies a serial port to add to the VM.
It has a format of Type:option1,option2,.... The field Type can be one
of the following values: FILE, DEVICE, PIPE, AUTO, or NONE.

-   `parallel` (string) - This specifies a parallel port to add to the VM. It
