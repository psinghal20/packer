-   `shutdown_command` (string) - The command to use to gracefully shut down the
machine once all the provisioning is done. By default this is an empty
string, which tells Packer to just forcefully shut down the machine.

-   `shutdown_timeout` (string) - The amount of time to wait after executing the
shutdown_command for the virtual machine to actually shut down. If it
doesn't shut down in this time, it is an error. By default, the timeout is
5m or five minutes.
