-   `ebs_volumes` ([]BlockDevice) - Add the block device
mappings to the AMI. The block device mappings allow for keys:

-   `ena_support` (*bool) - Enable enhanced networking (ENA but not
SriovNetSupport) on HVM-compatible AMIs. If set, add
ec2:ModifyInstanceAttribute to your AWS IAM policy. If false, this will
disable enhanced networking in the final AMI as opposed to passing the
setting through unchanged from the source. Note: you must make sure
enhanced networking is enabled on your instance. See Amazon's
documentation on enabling enhanced
networking.

-   `sriov_support` (bool) - Enable enhanced networking (SriovNetSupport but
not ENA) on HVM-compatible AMIs. If true, add
ec2:ModifyInstanceAttribute to your AWS IAM policy. Note: you must make
sure enhanced networking is enabled on your instance. See Amazon's
documentation on enabling enhanced
networking.
Default false.
