<!-- Code generated from the comments of the Config struct in builder/hyperv/iso/builder.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

-   `disk_size` (uint) - The size, in megabytes, of the hard disk to create
for the VM. By default, this is 40 GB.

-   `disk_block_size` (uint) - The block size of the VHD to be created.
Recommended disk block size for Linux hyper-v guests is 1 MiB. This
defaults to "32 MiB".

-   `memory` (uint) - The amount, in megabytes, of RAM to assign to the
VM. By default, this is 1 GB.

-   `secondary_iso_images` ([]string) - A list of ISO paths to
attach to a VM when it is booted. This is most useful for unattended
Windows installs, which look for an Autounattend.xml file on removable
media. By default, no secondary ISO will be attached.

-   `guest_additions_mode` (string) - If set to attach then attach and
mount the ISO image specified in guest_additions_path. If set to
none then guest additions are not attached and mounted; This is the
default.

-   `guest_additions_path` (string) - The path to the ISO image for guest
additions.

-   `vm_name` (string) - This is the name of the new virtual machine,
without the file extension. By default this is "packer-BUILDNAME",
where "BUILDNAME" is the name of the build.

-   `switch_name` (string) - The name of the switch to connect the virtual
machine to. By default, leaving this value unset will cause Packer to
try and determine the switch to use by looking for an external switch
that is up and running.

-   `switch_vlan_id` (string) - This is the VLAN of the virtual switch's
network card. By default none is set. If none is set then a VLAN is not
set on the switch's network card. If this value is set it should match
the VLAN specified in by vlan_id.

-   `mac_address` (string) - This allows a specific MAC address to be used on
the default virtual network card. The MAC address must be a string with
no delimiters, for example "0000deadbeef".

-   `vlan_id` (string) - This is the VLAN of the virtual machine's network
card for the new virtual machine. By default none is set. If none is set
then VLANs are not set on the virtual machine's network card.

-   `cpus` (uint) - The number of CPUs the virtual machine should use. If
this isn't specified, the default is 1 CPU.

-   `generation` (uint) - The Hyper-V generation for the virtual machine. By
default, this is 1. Generation 2 Hyper-V virtual machines do not support
floppy drives. In this scenario use secondary_iso_images instead. Hard
drives and DVD drives will also be SCSI and not IDE.

-   `enable_mac_spoofing` (bool) - If true enable MAC address spoofing
for the virtual machine. This defaults to false.

-   `use_legacy_network_adapter` (bool) - If true use a legacy network adapter as the NIC.
This defaults to false. A legacy network adapter is fully emulated NIC, and is thus
supported by various exotic operating systems, but this emulation requires
additional overhead and should only be used if absolutely necessary.

-   `enable_dynamic_memory` (bool) - If true enable dynamic memory for
the virtual machine. This defaults to false.

-   `enable_secure_boot` (bool) - If true enable secure boot for the
virtual machine. This defaults to false. See secure_boot_template
below for additional settings.

-   `secure_boot_template` (string) - The secure boot template to be
configured. Valid values are "MicrosoftWindows" (Windows) or
"MicrosoftUEFICertificateAuthority" (Linux). This only takes effect if
enable_secure_boot is set to "true". This defaults to "MicrosoftWindows".

-   `enable_virtualization_extensions` (bool) - If true enable
virtualization extensions for the virtual machine. This defaults to
false. For nested virtualization you need to enable MAC spoofing,
disable dynamic memory and have at least 4GB of RAM assigned to the
virtual machine.

-   `temp_path` (string) - The location under which Packer will create a
directory to house all the VM files and folders during the build.
By default %TEMP% is used which, for most systems, will evaluate to
%USERPROFILE%/AppData/Local/Temp.

-   `configuration_version` (string) - This allows you to set the vm version when
 calling New-VM to generate the vm.

-   `keep_registered` (bool) - If "true", Packer will not delete the VM from
The Hyper-V manager.

-   `communicator` (string) - Communicator
-   `disk_additional_size` ([]uint) - The size or sizes of any
additional hard disks for the VM in megabytes. If this is not specified
then the VM will only contain a primary hard disk. Additional drives
will be attached to the SCSI interface only. The builder uses
expandable rather than fixed-size virtual hard disks, so the actual
file representing the disk will not use the full size unless it is
full.

-   `skip_compaction` (bool) - If true skip compacting the hard disk for
the virtual machine when exporting. This defaults to false.

-   `skip_export` (bool) - If true Packer will skip the export of the VM.
If you are interested only in the VHD/VHDX files, you can enable this
option. The resulting VHD/VHDX file will be output to
<output_directory>/Virtual Hard Disks. By default this option is false
and Packer will export the VM to output_directory.

-   `differencing_disk` (bool) - If true enables differencing disks. Only
the changes will be written to the new disk. This is especially useful if
your source is a VHD/VHDX. This defaults to false.

-   `use_fixed_vhd_format` (bool) - If true, creates the boot disk on the
virtual machine as a fixed VHD format disk. The default is false, which
creates a dynamic VHDX format disk. This option requires setting
generation to 1, skip_compaction to true, and
differencing_disk to false. Additionally, any value entered for
disk_block_size will be ignored. The most likely use case for this
option is outputing a disk that is in the format required for upload to
Azure.

-   `headless` (bool) - Packer defaults to building Hyper-V virtual
machines by launching a GUI that shows the console of the machine being
built. When this value is set to true, the machine will start without a
console.
