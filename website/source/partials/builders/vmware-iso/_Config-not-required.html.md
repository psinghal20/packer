-   `disk_additional_size` ([]uint) - The size(s) of any additional
hard disks for the VM in megabytes. If this is not specified then the VM
will only contain a primary hard disk. The builder uses expandable, not
fixed-size virtual hard disks, so the actual file representing the disk will
not use the full size unless it is full.

-   `disk_adapter_type` (string) - The adapter type of the VMware virtual disk
to create. This option is for advanced usage, modify only if you know what
you're doing. Some of the options you can specify are ide, sata, nvme
or scsi (which uses the "lsilogic" scsi interface by default). If you
specify another option, Packer will assume that you're specifying a scsi
interface of that specified type. For more information, please consult the

Virtual Disk Manager User's Guide for desktop VMware clients.
For ESXi, refer to the proper ESXi documentation.

-   `vmdk_name` (string) - The filename of the virtual disk that'll be created,
without the extension. This defaults to packer.

-   `disk_size` (uint) - The size of the hard disk for the VM in megabytes.
The builder uses expandable, not fixed-size virtual hard disks, so the
actual file representing the disk will not use the full size unless it
is full. By default this is set to 40000 (about 40 GB).

-   `disk_type_id` (string) - The type of VMware virtual disk to create. This
option is for advanced usage.

-   `format` (string) - Either "ovf", "ova" or "vmx", this specifies the output
format of the exported virtual machine. This defaults to "ovf".
Before using this option, you need to install ovftool. This option
currently only works when option remote_type is set to "esx5".
Since ovftool is only capable of password based authentication
remote_password must be set when exporting the VM.

-   `cdrom_adapter_type` (string) - The adapter type (or bus) that will be used
by the cdrom device. This is chosen by default based on the disk adapter
type. VMware tends to lean towards ide for the cdrom device unless
sata is chosen for the disk adapter and so Packer attempts to mirror
this logic. This field can be specified as either ide, sata, or scsi.

-   `guest_os_type` (string) - The guest OS type being installed. This will be
set in the VMware VMX. By default this is other. By specifying a more
specific OS type, VMware may perform some optimizations or virtual hardware
changes to better support the operating system running in the
virtual machine.

-   `version` (string) - The vmx hardware
version
for the new virtual machine. Only the default value has been tested, any
other value is experimental. Default value is 9.

-   `vm_name` (string) - This is the name of the VMX file for the new virtual
machine, without the file extension. By default this is packer-BUILDNAME,
where "BUILDNAME" is the name of the build.

-   `vmx_disk_template_path` (string) - VMX Disk Template Path
-   `vmx_template_path` (string) - Path to a configuration
template that defines the
contents of the virtual machine VMX file for VMware. This is for advanced
users only as this can render the virtual machine non-functional. See
below for more information. For basic VMX modifications, try
vmx_data first.
