<!-- Code generated from the comments of the AMIConfig struct in builder/amazon/common/ami_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

-   `ami_description` (string) - The description to set for the resulting
AMI(s). By default this description is empty. This is a template
engine, see Build template
data for more information.

-   `ami_virtualization_type` (string) - The description to set for the resulting AMI(s). By default this
description is empty. This is a [template
engine](../templates/engine.html), see [Build template
data](#build-template-data) for more information.

-   `ami_users` ([]string) - A list of account IDs that have access to
launch the resulting AMI(s). By default no additional users other than the
user creating the AMI has permissions to launch it.

-   `ami_groups` ([]string) - A list of groups that have access to
launch the resulting AMI(s). By default no groups have permission to launch
the AMI. all will make the AMI publicly accessible.

-   `ami_product_codes` ([]string) - A list of product codes to
associate with the AMI. By default no product codes are associated with the
AMI.

-   `ami_regions` ([]string) - A list of regions to copy the AMI to.
Tags and attributes are copied along with the AMI. AMI copying takes time
depending on the size of the AMI, but will generally take many minutes.

-   `skip_region_validation` (bool) - Set to true if you want to skip
validation of the ami_regions configuration option. Default false.

-   `tags` (TagMap) - Tags applied to the AMI. This is a
[template engine](/docs/templates/engine.html), see [Build template
data](#build-template-data) for more information.

-   `ena_support` (*bool) - Enable enhanced networking (ENA but not
SriovNetSupport) on HVM-compatible AMIs. If set, add
ec2:ModifyInstanceAttribute to your AWS IAM policy. If false, this will
disable enhanced networking in the final AMI as opposed to passing the
setting through unchanged from the source. Note: you must make sure
enhanced networking is enabled on your instance. [Amazon's
documentation on enabling enhanced
networking](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/enhanced-networking.html#enabling_enhanced_networking).

-   `sriov_support` (bool) - Enable enhanced networking (SriovNetSupport but
not ENA) on HVM-compatible AMIs. If true, add
ec2:ModifyInstanceAttribute to your AWS IAM policy. Note: you must make
sure enhanced networking is enabled on your instance. See Amazon's
documentation on enabling enhanced
networking.
Default false.

-   `force_deregister` (bool) - Force Packer to first deregister an existing
AMI if one with the same name already exists. Default false.

-   `force_delete_snapshot` (bool) - Force Packer to delete snapshots
associated with AMIs, which have been deregistered by force_deregister.
Default false.

-   `encrypt_boot` (*bool) - Whether or not to encrypt the resulting AMI when
copying a provisioned instance to an AMI. By default, Packer will keep the
encryption setting to what it was in the source image. Setting false will
result in an unencrypted image, and true will result in an encrypted one.

-   `kms_key_id` (string) - ID, alias or ARN of the KMS key to use for boot volume encryption. This
only applies to the main `region`, other regions where the AMI will be
copied will be encrypted by the default EBS KMS key. For valid formats
see *KmsKeyId* in the [AWS API docs -
CopyImage](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_CopyImage.html).
This field is validated by Packer, when using an alias, you will have to
prefix `kms_key_id` with `alias/`.

-   `region_kms_key_ids` (map[string]string) - a map of regions to copy the ami to, along with the custom kms key id
(alias or arn) to use for encryption for that region. Keys must match
the regions provided in ami_regions. If you just want to encrypt using a
default ID, you can stick with kms_key_id and ami_regions. If you want a
region to be encrypted with that region's default key ID, you can use an
empty string "" instead of a key id in this map. (e.g. "us-east-1": "")
However, you cannot use default key IDs if you are using this in
conjunction with snapshot_users -- in that situation you must use custom
keys. For valid formats see KmsKeyId in the AWS API docs - CopyImage.

-   `snapshot_tags` (TagMap) - Tags to apply to snapshot.
They will override AMI tags if already applied to snapshot. This is a
template engine, see Build template
data for more information.

-   `snapshot_users` ([]string) - A list of account IDs that have
access to create volumes from the snapshot(s). By default no additional
users other than the user creating the AMI has permissions to create
volumes from the backing snapshot(s).

-   `snapshot_groups` ([]string) - A list of groups that have access to
create volumes from the snapshot(s). By default no groups have permission
to create volumes from the snapshot(s). all will make the snapshot
publicly accessible.
