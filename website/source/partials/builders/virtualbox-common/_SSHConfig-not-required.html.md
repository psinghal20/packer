-   `ssh_host_port_min` (int) - The minimum and
maximum port to use for the SSH port on the host machine which is forwarded
to the SSH port on the guest machine. Because Packer often runs in parallel,
Packer will choose a randomly available port in this range to use as the
host port. By default this is 2222 to 4444.

-   `ssh_host_port_max` (int) - SSH Host Port Max
-   `ssh_skip_nat_mapping` (bool) - Defaults to false. When enabled, Packer
does not setup forwarded port mapping for SSH requests and uses ssh_port
on the host to communicate to the virtual machine.

-   `ssh_wait_timeout` (time.Duration) - These are deprecated, but we keep them around for BC
TODO(@mitchellh): remove
