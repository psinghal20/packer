-   `vboxmanage` ([][]string) - Custom VBoxManage commands to
execute in order to further customize the virtual machine being created. The
value of this is an array of commands to execute. The commands are executed
in the order defined in the template. For each command, the command is
defined itself as an array of strings, where each string represents a single
argument on the command-line to VBoxManage (but excluding
VBoxManage itself). Each arg is treated as a configuration
template, where the Name
variable is replaced with the VM name. More details on how to use
VBoxManage are below.
