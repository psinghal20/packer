-   `linked` (bool) - By default Packer creates a 'full' clone of
the virtual machine specified in source_path. The resultant virtual
machine is fully independant from the parent it was cloned from.

-   `remote_type` (string) - The type of remote machine that will be used to
build this VM rather than a local desktop product. The only value accepted
for this currently is esx5. If this is not set, a desktop product will
be used. By default, this is not set.

-   `vm_name` (string) - This is the name of the VMX file for the new virtual
machine, without the file extension. By default this is packer-BUILDNAME,
where "BUILDNAME" is the name of the build.
